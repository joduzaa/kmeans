>Monitoring Convergence
>Create a text file called "interpretation.txt" and fill in your answers to the questions below.
>Run k-means using 3 clusters on the 1953 and 2008 datasets separately.
>What do you see? Take note of how the clusters change from 1953 to 2008. You will need to pay attention
>not only to which countries are in clusters together, but also to the Life Expectancy and Birth Rates for those clusters.

The size of the clusters are very close for the two years. 1953: 88,60,48 and for 2008: 91,62,43.

The same trend can be seen. That the higher the life expectancy then the birth rate is lower.

In 1953 the cluster with the most countries also have the lowest mean life expectancy (39.4), but in 2008 the cluster with
the most countries has the highest mean life expectancy (76.6)

The life expectancy is higher in 2008 than in 1953, but the birth rate is lower in 2008 than in 1953. 
No country moved to a worst cluster with respect to Life expectancy from 1953 to 2008. Countries either moved up or stayed 
in the same cluster.

The Maldives; United Arab Emirates; Turkey; China; Bahrain; Vietnam and Tunisia was the biggest movers from 1953 to 2008. 
In 1953 these countries were in the cluster with the lowest Life expectancy and in 2008 they moved to the cluster with 
the highest life expectancy.



>Next, run the algorithm with 4 clusters on dataBoth.csv. Note any observations in your text file. 
>Which countries are moving up clusters? 
>How does "(2008)South Africa" compare to "(1953)United States"? 
>Are there any 2008 countries that are in a cluster that is made up mostly of 1953 countries? Try and explain why. 
>Are there any 1953 countries that are in a cluster that is made up of mostly 2008 countries? Try and explain why.

South Africa (2008) and United States (1953) are in the same cluster (Cluster 2). The US just cam out of the Second World
War and was rebuilding itself. South Africa is also in a rebuilding phase after the end of Apartheid. 

Afghanistan (2008) is in a cluster where all the other countries are 1953 countries. This is due to the fact that Afghanistan
is a war torn country. During wartime the life expectancy is low, but after a war the birth rate goes up as can be seen that
in 1953 the second world war ended and there was a boom in births.

In Cluster 3 (Highest Life Expectancy) there is 10 countries from 1953, where the rest is from 2008. 
(1953)Luxembourg; (1953)Norway; (1953)Austria; (1953)Belgium; (1953)Germany; (1953)Denmark; (1953)Sweden; 
(1953)Switzerland; (1953)United Kingdom; (1953)Channel Islands

These were prosperous countries by 1953 due to rapid reconstruction after the war. They just build on these in the following years.
It is easier to build on existing foundations then to start from scratch.
